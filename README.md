## Future work

* Change the marker with the real position of the bus with an icon that better represent the bus in movement.

* When the cursor is on a bus stop marker, show the waiting time for the bus to arrive.
* Improve the user experience by giving the user the option to change the style of the map.
* Enhance the look and feel of the webpage by repositioning and changing the style of the buttons.
