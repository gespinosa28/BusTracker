## Future work

* Change the marker with the real position of the bus with an icon, such as an actual bus, that better depicts a bus in movement.
* Higlight in the map the route followed by the bus as it travels between MIT and Harvard.
* When the cursor is on a bus stop marker, show the current estimated time of arrival for the bus.
* Improve the user experience by giving the user the option to change the style of the map.
* Enhance the look and feel of the webpage by repositioning and changing the style of the buttons.
